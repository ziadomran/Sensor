# Sensor
Sensor Project
This was my senior project in 2016. This is basically a car sensor. The sensor uses the ultrasonic an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to send ultrasonic messages, then the messages hit the objects and return to the sensor. We used a the microcontroller (Pic18F45K22) to calculate the distance traveled then displays the distance between the sensor and the object on an LCD screen and depending on the distance, 1 to 10 LEDs will light up. In addition to that, we included a buzzer that will beeps more frequently when the sensor becomes goes closer to the object.
